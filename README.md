# GPS-pPLM
**Note**: The GPS-pPLM, which incorporated transformer and large langueage model(LLM), was developed to predict new phospharylation site in prokaryotes. 

## Requirements

The main requirements are listed below:

* Python 3.8
* torch
* Scikit-Learn
* Matplotlib

## The description of LyMOI source codes

* score.py

    The code is used for the score and input PSP(10,10). The closer the score is to 1, the more likely it is that this site is a phosphorylation site


## OS Requirements

Above codes have been tested on the following systems:

* Windows: Windos10

## Hardware Requirements

All codes and softwares could run on a "normal" desktop computer, no non-standard hardware is needed.

## Installation guide

All codes can run directly on a "normal" computer with Python 3.8 installed, no extra installation is required.

## Instruction

For users who want to run GPS-pPLM in own computer, you should import the required packages. Then set the correct file path, including input and output files, and finally run the .py file of the model to obtain the result file.
